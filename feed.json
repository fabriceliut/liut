We need the same sunlight energy to feed us as vegetables, the same water to refresh our body and mind.<br><br><strong>The Earth is our only home and our only boundary.</strong> No others boundaries needed. We need identities and diversity because this is the richness of life, this make us transform and evolve.<br><br>Prosperous life start by listening, observing, learning how an older and wiser system than us is working. Biomimicry is a science that can help us understand this system which we belong.<br><br>Design thinking propose us a &ldquo;user centric&rdquo; point of view. <strong>LIUT protocol research a &ldquo;natural systemic thinking&rdquo;</strong>.
